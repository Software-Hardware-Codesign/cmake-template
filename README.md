# cmake-template

A template for embedded C libraries development.

This template consists of the following modules: 
1) foobar-core: for core code, this module gets compiled to a static library.
2) foobar-examples: for library examples (or your final runnable target).

This template uses the avr toolchain, though you could edit it to use other toolchains, through editing the sandbox environment scripts.
